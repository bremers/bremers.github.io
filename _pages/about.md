**I'm currently on the job market for industry Research Scientist / User Experience Researcher positions starting in May 2026.**

I’m a [PhD Candidate](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/bremers) in Information Science at Cornell University, based at Cornell Tech in New York City. My research, advised by [Wendy Ju](https://wendyju.com) and [François Guimbretière](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/guimbretière), explores how interactive and intelligent machines can support human creativity during fabrication and design tasks. My doctoral work integrates human–computer interaction, design, and systems development, and I am a Cornell PiTech AI in Arts & Culture Fellow.

I bring 8+ years of combined academic and industry research experience, with internships at Walt Disney Imagineering R&D, Accenture Labs, Toyota Research Institute, and National Taiwan University. Prior to Cornell, I worked as a Human–Machine Interface Researcher at Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, where I collaborated with the University of Cambridge and was recognized through the Oxford–Cambridge RisingWISE program and JLR & Tata Innovista innovation awards.

My academic background spans Information Science (M.S., Cornell), Artificial Intelligence (M.S., Utrecht University), and Industrial Design (B.S., TU Eindhoven, see [my portfolio](https://bremers.github.io/cv/Bremers_portfolio2025.pdf)). In 2020, I was awarded the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Industrial Fellowship to pursue doctoral study at Cambridge.

My work sits at the intersection of HCI, design, and emerging technologies, with a focus on building systems that empower people to create. Alongside research, I maintain a creative practice and have received recognition in design, writing, and art.
