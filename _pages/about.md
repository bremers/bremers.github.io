I'm a [PhD Candidate](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/bremers) in Information Science at Cornell University, based at Cornell Tech in New York City. I work with [Wendy Ju](https://wendyju.com) and [François Guimbretière](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/guimbretière) on interactive, intelligent physical machines that support people during fabrication tasks. My minor is in computer science, with a focus on computer vision and graphics.

This summer, I will be interning at Walt Disney Imagineering, continuing my exploration of design, interactivity, and emerging technologies. I’ve previously interned at Accenture Labs, Toyota Research Institute, and National Taiwan University. Before Cornell, I worked in industry as a Human-Machine Interface Researcher at Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, collaborating with the University of Cambridge. While at Jaguar, I was selected for Oxford-Cambridge RisingWISE, and recognized for innovation through JLR & Tata Innovista.

My academic background includes an M.S. in Information Science (Cornell), an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence (Utrecht University), and a B.S. in Industrial Design (TU Eindhoven, see [my portfolio](https://bremers.github.io/cv/Bremers_portfolio2025.pdf)). In 2020, I was awarded the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Industrial Fellowship to pursue a PhD in Engineering at the University of Cambridge. 

My work sits at the intersection of human-computer interaction, design, and emerging technologies. Alongside research, I maintain a creative practice and have received recognition in design, writing, and art.
