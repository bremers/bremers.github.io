[PhD Candidate](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/bremers) in Information Science at Cornell University, based at Cornell Tech, New York, NY. I work with [Wendy Ju](https://wendyju.com) and [François Guimbretière](https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/guimbretière), investigating physical machines as smart, interactive collaborators to support people during fabrication tasks. My minor is in computer science -- mainly computer vision and computer graphics. 

I hold an M.S. in Information Science from Cornell, an M.S. in Artificial Intelligence from Utrecht University, and a B.S. in Industrial Design from TU Eindhoven. I briefly studied automotive human-technology interaction at Warwick University. From 2017 to 2020, I worked as a Human-Machine Interface Researcher at Jaguar Land Rover, UK, collaborating with Cambridge University. While at Jaguar, I was selected for the 2018 Oxford-Cambridge cohort of Rising Women in Science and Engineering (RisingWISE), and recognized for innovation through JLR & Tata Innovista. I also worked at Toyota Research Institute and Accenture Labs in the Bay Area, and at National Taiwan University.

In addition to my technical work, I worked on art and design projects, and won awards in creative and print writing. In 2020, I received the Royal Commission of 1851 Industrial Fellowship to pursue a PhD in Engineering at University of Cambridge.
