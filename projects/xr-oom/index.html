It’s easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.</p> <p>You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, <em>bled</em> for your project, and then… you reveal it’s glory in the next row of images.</p> </body></html>
