Excited that two posters got accepted into ACM CUI (conversational user interfaces): our [analysis of social discomfort in shared car trips](https://bremers.github.io/papers/Bremers2024Social.pdf), and a preliminary study on [situated conversational interfaces for task guidance](https://bremers.github.io/papers/Bremers2024Situated.pdf). I will present our work in Luxembourg in July!
