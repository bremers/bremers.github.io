The collaborative work I was a part of during my time at Jaguar Land Rover has now resulted in another accepted paper! Together with our colleagues from Cambridge University, "Driver Profiling and Bayesian Workload Estimation Using Naturalistic Peripheral Detection Study Data" [can now be found](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10244092) in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles.
