[Accenture's 2024 TechVision report](https://www.accenture.com/content/dam/accenture/final/accenture-com/document-2/Accenture-Tech-Vision-2024.pdf) features our recent work on [learning from facial reactions](https://bad-dataset.tech.cornell.edu).
"Similarly, a 2023 research paper from Accenture and Cornell University describes a way human-robot collaborations can benefit when robots can identify when they’ve made an error based on implicit reactions from humans they interact with – much like how people use social cues to recognize their
own mistakes. The authors built a dataset of bystander responses to human and robot errors and used it as input to a deep-learning model to predict failures. By creating these systems that are sensitive to human social signals, they are efficiently using the expertise of human perception and action as a marker for mitigating robotic errors."
