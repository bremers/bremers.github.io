While I won't be attending CHI this year, Frank Bu will present our late-breaking report with field notes on deploying research robots in public spaces. We hope that this work can contribute to more in-the-wild human-robot interaction studies! Read our paper in [the ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3613905.3651044).
